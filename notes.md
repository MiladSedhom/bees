req body => {
user id,
todos:[todo:{}]
}

setTodos()
req
setTodos(res.data)
foucs

setTodos done
foucs done
onchange => req
setTodos(res.data)

well what if the user created 3 todos then edited one that well mean there wont be an
so a soultin would be to incule all recenlty added todos in the req

if isRecentlyAdded
todos.filter all the recently added element
create em all

//another apporach would be making a queue in which i add the the RA todos
=> setTodo() create a Q to hold its data
maybe actually store the id on that q
but meh sound like it would take more thinkig and im so sleepy rn

container => array.map([list UD].onClick=> setCurrentCatgories or setCurrentList)

list => {name, [catgories], \_id}

category => string
